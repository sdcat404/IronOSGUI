# Iron OS

A lightweight, experimental operating system built using the [COSMOS](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos) project in C#.  
Iron OS features a basic GUI, an arrow-key-controlled mouse, and a simple terminal window — all running without an underlying OS.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Text-based GUI desktop
- ✅ Arrow-key controlled mouse
- ✅ Clickable elements (apps open via keyboard "click")
- ✅ Built-in terminal window
- ✅ Boots from USB or ISO
- ✅ No dependencies — runs directly on real hardware

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022
- [COSMOS UserKit (2022+)](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/releases)
- A real machine or USB boot setup (GUI may not render in VMs)

---

🕹 Controls
Arrow Keys → Move the mouse

Spacebar → Click

Type in Terminal → For future CLI interactions

---

⚠️ Notes
Cosmos GUI support is limited in VMs — real hardware recommended

You can extend Iron OS with your own apps, menus, and system features

---

🎯 Roadmap
 Add real mouse support

 Add app window manager

 File system support

 Themed desktop

 Multitasking simulation

---

🧠 Why Iron OS?
Iron OS is a playground for learning low-level systems in a high-level language.
Perfect for understanding how GUIs, input, and rendering work — without diving into assembly or C.
